# WeatherYouKnow

### What is it?
 This is a weather website created by Michael Jenkins as a project for his Computer Science classes at PSU.
### What does it use?
 It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, and then displays it using a variety of graphs using ChartJS. 
 It's structured using Bootstrap, and has a small amount of jQuery 
### Does it have any special features?
 It features an *Activities* page, which suggests the best days to perform different activities, as well as a dark mode
### How do I access it?
 It can be accessed [here](https://kiptheturtlebear.github.io/index.html)
### What additional features are planned?
 - ~~Currently the activity page only suggests the first "good day" for a given activity. I'd like this to suggest all "good days" in the week instead~~ Finished
 - ~~Style Activity page better~~ Finished
 - ~~Dark Mode~~ Finished
 - A map would be cool to have, but I'm unsure of how it would help the usability or provide more features
